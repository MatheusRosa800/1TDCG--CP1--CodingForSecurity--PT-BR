# FIAP - 1° Checkpoint - Coding for Security

## Introdution
Checkpoint carried out with the aim of putting into practice all the knowledge in Python acquired in the subject of Coding for Security, taught by [Fábio Cabrini].(https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-cabrini/).

## Participants
- Eduardo dos Santos
- Henrique Lorenzetti
- Jorge Gabriel
- Matheus Rosa
- Pedro Augusto

## Challenge
The challenge consist on create a program that ask the user to inform a quantity of numbers that later on will be shown from the Fibonacci sequence and after putting it on the screen.

### What is Fibonacci Sequence?
The sequence was named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who first described it in his book Liber Abaci, published in 1202. The Fibonacci sequence is found in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves in plants, in shells molluscs, the shape of galaxies and many other things. Furthermore, the sequence has interesting properties and is studied in many areas of mathematics and computer science.

### How does it work?
It is a numerical sequence which each number is the sum/addition of the two numbers that precede it. Starting with 0 and 1, the first numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.

## step by step to execute the program

### 1° Step - Open the terminal

### 2° Step - Get the project from github,
To get the files type this command:

git clone https://github.com/MatheusRosa800/CP1---Coding-for-Security
cd CP1---Coding-for-Security

### 3° Step - Execute the command below to open the python program

python3 index.py

### 4° Step - write the quantity of numbers that you want to see

## Error handling implementations
- [ ] Problem
- [x] Solution

---
- [ ] The user informs data that are not whole numbers.

- [x] Validation with try except to validate data entry.

- [ ] User asks to display less than 2 numbers.

- [x] Validation with if to handle the quantity inserted by the user with the following logical test quantity < 2.

- [ ] The user forces any type of input not allowed.

- [x] The program handles the error and displays a message to the user and returns the prompt to type again.
